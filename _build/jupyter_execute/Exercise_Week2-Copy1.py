# Week 2 - Exercise

## Problem Statement

A perfectly mixed gas permeation module is used to separate carbon dioxide from nitrogen using a poly
(2,6-dimethylphenylene oxide) membrane	($P_{CO_2}=0.034\times10^{-13}$ $P_{N_2}=0.089\times10^{-13} [cm^3 (STP) cm / cm^2 s Pa]$). The process carried out at a temperature of 25$^oC$. 
The feed flowrate is 20.0 mol\% carbon dioxide.
The module has 15.0 $m^2$ of membrane. The module is operated with a retentate pressure of 5.5 atm
and a permeate pressure of 1.01 atm. 

The permeate is enriched to 38.0 mol\% in carbon dioxide. The membrane thickness is $\ell = 2.0 \times 10^{-4}$ cm. 

- Draw a scheme of the unit clearly labelling all the streams and relevant variables.

- Completely characterise the unit, by computing feed, permeate and retentate flow rates, cut, and retentate composition.
