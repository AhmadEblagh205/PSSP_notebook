# Week 5 - Exercise

## Problem Statement

A protein mixture has been separated through an ion-exchange chromatography process. The residence time of the column in non-adsorbing conditons is $t_0=1$ min.
The chromatogram resulting from the separation is reported in the following:

### Determine:
- How many components in the mixture can you identify from the chromatogram?
- What is the selectivity of this column for each couple of components? 
- Assuming a linear adsorption isotherm holds in all cases, what conclusions can you draw about adsorption thermodynamics of each component in the column?
- What is the number of theoretical plates associated to the elution of each component you have identified? If the coulmn is 10 cm long, what is the height equivalent of a theoretical plate for each component of the mixture? 
- Compute the resolution relative to each couple of components in the chromatogram. Does it depend only on the adsorption thermodynamics?
- Comment on the separation performances of the column. Does it allow for a sharp resolution of all components?
