## Problem Statement

Compute the total membrane area necessary to produce 10 l/h purified water (0.03 wt% NaCl) through a single stage Reverse Osmosis separation of seawater (water 4 wt% NaCl). 
The feed pressure is 100 bar and the composition in the retentate stream is 7 wt%.  
The permeate stream is at ambient pressure (1 bar), all streams are at 25$^o$ C, and the osmotic pressure in bar is captured by the semiempirical expression: 

\begin{equation*}
\pi=\frac{1.12}{14.5}T\sum_{i=1}^Nc_i
\end{equation*}

Where T is the temperature in K,  $N$ is the total number of ionic species in solution, and ci is the concentration expressed in $[mol/l]$. 

The asymmetric membrane used for the separation has a permeance of $0.01\,[m h^{-1} bar^{-1}]$.

Once you have solved the problem consider the following questions:

- Can you evaluate the salt rejection in this process, and salt passage? 
- How would you modify the operation of the system to increase the productivity of the process?
